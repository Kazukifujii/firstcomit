SYMGRP find   # 'find' evaluate space-group symmetry (just from lattice) automatically.
              #
              # Usually 'find is OK', but lmf may use lower symmetry
          # if you did not supply accurate structure.
              # 'lmchk foobar --pr60' shows, what symmetry is recognized.

              # If symmetry of electronic system has lower symmetry than the lattice symmetry,
              # we need to choose lower symmetry than 'find' gives.

%const kmxa=5  # =radial degree of freedom to expand eigenfuncitons in tail sites.
               #  kmxa=5 is good for pwemax \sim 4 or less.
               # larger kmxa is better but time-consuming. A rule of thumb: kmxa>pwemax in Ry.

               # Enlarge this, when your enlarge pwemax, and check little dependence on kmxa.
